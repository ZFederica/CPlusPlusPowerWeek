## The Daisyworld simulation

**Daisyworld** <sup> [[1]](#bibliography)</sup> is a computer simulation of a
_hypothetical world_ orbiting around a star whose radiant energy slowly varies
with time.

Its original version was introduced by James Lovelock and Andrew Watson as a
_toy model_ to show how **living creatures** (_biotas_) **and the environment**
they populate **evolve as an interconnected system**, one affecting the other.

**The only living beings** populating Daisyworld are (indeed) **daises**, that
(in the simplest model) exist in two varieties: _white-_ and _black-_ petaled.
**White-daisies** mostly _reflect light_, while **black-daisies** mostly absorb
light.

The light absorbed or reflected (_albedo_) by daisies, contributes to the
variation of the temperature of a local patch of land, or to the overall
Daisyworld average temperature, respectively.

The simulation **tracks the two daisy populations** and the Daisyworld **average
temperature** as the **star beams grow more powerful**.

Results<sup> [[2]](#bibliography)</sup> show that, as the radiation of the star
increases:

1. the fraction of Daisyworld populated by white and black daisies varies but,
   **the overall population remains almost constant** in a wide star radiation
   range;
2. similar conclusions hold true also for **temperature**, that **remains
   stable** in Daisyworld, if compared to a lifeless planet orbiting at the same
   distance, that is exposed to an identical stellar activity.

Several variants of the _toy model_ were developed over the years (e.g.
deterministic, as the one described above, or stochastic - some examples can be
found in<sup> [[3]](#bibliography)</sup> and<sup> [[4]](#bibliography)</sup>).

## Project overview and day-by-day activities

During the week you will be guided though the development of a _stochastic
Daisyworld_ model.

An overview of the project structure, highlighting the main concepts involved,
the simulation parameters and the evolution algorithm is available
[here](project_overview.md).

Every day, guidelines will be provided in order to _translate to C++_ what
described in the project overview page:

- [Monday](day1.md): working area configuration, use of _clang-format_,
  getting familiar with the `g++` compiler;
- [Tuesday](day2.md): writing functions and testing them with _doctest_;
- [Wednesday](day3.md): implementing Daisyworld components using C++ (1);
- [Thursday](day4.md): implementing Daisyworld components using C++ (2);
- [Friday](day5.md): compilation model, separation of the project into
  multiple files, use of _CMake_.

> :warning: The actual distribution of activities during each day's project
> development session is subject to variations to adapt to the topics covered
> until that moment during the lectures.
